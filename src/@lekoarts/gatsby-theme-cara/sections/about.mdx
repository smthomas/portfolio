## About

> I'm a developer focused on building a better web. I'm a proponent for K-12 STEM/STEAM education and developing the next generation of engineers and scientists.

I am a Staff Engineer at Gatsby working on making Gatsby and Drupal play nice together. I will probably add more to this later...
